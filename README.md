# A github file explorer.

  Just to give a username/repo_name in the search box and it will 
  collects all the contents of the repository of that particular username giving an option 
  to download the file.
  It is using github API "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}".
  
  All the resources required are in package.json.
  Just npm install and the required modules will be installed in node_modules folder. 
  
  Then by running ./node_modules/.bin/gulp serve 
  you should see the project locally on your machine at http://localhost:8080.
  
  Then just enter the name of the github user slash with his/her repo name to explore files contained in that repository.
  
  Cheers... do whatever you want to do.
